Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a \"complete\" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for \"full\" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.\r\n\r\n                A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links hundreds of millions of other computers and users.\r\n\r\n                Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.\r\n\r\n                Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nexport default function Keyboard() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"contentof\">\r\n            <h1 className=\"heading\">Keyboard</h1>\r\n            <p className=\"paragraph\">\r\n                A computer keyboard is a peripheral input device modeled after the typewriter keyboard[1] which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Replacing early punched cards and paper tape technology, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards have been the main input method for computers since the 1970s, supplemented by the computer mouse since the 1980s.\r\n\r\n                Keyboard keys (buttons) typically have a set of characters engraved or printed on them, and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol. However, producing some symbols may require pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence.[2] While most keyboard keys produce letters, numbers or symbols (characters), other keys or simultaneous key presses can prompt the computer to execute system commands, such as such as the Control-Alt-Delete combination used with Microsoft Windows.[3][4] In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software: the information sent to the computer, the scan code, tells it only which key (or keys) on which row and column, was pressed or released.[5]\r\n\r\n                In normal usage, the keyboard is used as a text entry interface for typing text, numbers, and symbols into application software such as a word processor, web browser or social media app.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nexport default function Software() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"contentof\">\r\n            <h1 className=\"heading\">Software</h1>\r\n            <p className=\"paragraph\">\r\n                Software is a collection of instructions that tell a computer how to work.[1][2] This is in contrast to hardware, from which the system is built and actually performs the work.\r\n\r\n                At the lowest programming level, executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU). Machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the user. The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to \"jump\" to a different instruction, or is interrupted by the operating system. As of 2015, most personal computers, smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together, and computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past.\r\n\r\n                The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages. They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to natural languages than machine languages.[3] High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler or an interpreter or a combination of the two. Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language, which has a strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an assembler.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nexport default function Hardware() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"contentof\">\r\n            <h1 className=\"heading\">Hardware</h1>\r\n            <p className=\"paragraph\">\r\n                Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the case,[1] central processing unit (CPU), monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard.[2]\r\n\r\n                By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is \"hard\" or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is \"soft\" because it is easy to change.\r\n\r\n                Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction.

This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface of a computer.\r\n\r\n                The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968. Mice originally used two separate wheels to track movement across a surface; one in the X-dimension, and one in the Y. Later, the standard design shifted to utilise a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion. Most modern mice use optical sensors that have no moving parts. Though originally all mice were connected to a computer by a cable, some modern mice are cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system.\r\n\r\n                In addition to moving a cursor, computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as selection of a menu item on a display. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and scroll wheels, which enable additional control and dimensional input.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n","import './App.css';\nimport Header from \"./Components/Header\";\nimport Ribbonof from \"./Components/Ribbonof\";\nimport Footer from \"./Components/Footer\";\nimport About from \"./Components/About\";\nimport ContactUs from \"./Components/ContactUs\";\n\n\nimport Computer from \"./Components/Computer\";\nimport Keyboard from \"./Components/Keyboard\";\nimport Software from \"./Components/Software\";\nimport Hardware from \"./Components/Hardware\";\nimport Mouse from \"./Components/Mouse\";\n\n\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n  Switch,\n  Route,\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n    <Router>\n      <Header></Header>\n      <Ribbonof></Ribbonof>\n      <Footer></Footer>\n\n      \n      <Switch >\n          <Route exact path=\"/Computer\">\n            < Computer/>\n          </Route>\n          \n          <Route exact path=\"/About\">\n            < About/>\n          </Route>\n          \n          <Route exact path=\"/ContactUs\">\n            < ContactUs/>\n          </Route>\n\n          <Route exact path=\"/Software\">\n            <Software/>\n          </Route>\n\n          <Route exact path=\"/Hardware\">\n            < Hardware/>\n          </Route>\n\n          <Route exact path=\"/Keyboard\">\n            < Keyboard/>\n          </Route>\n\n          <Route exact path=\"/Mouse\">\n            <Mouse />\n          </Route>\n          \n      </Switch>\n      </Router>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
